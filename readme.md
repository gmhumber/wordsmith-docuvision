# WordSmith DocuVision app

WordSmith DocuVision is a text manipulation website providing Optical Character Recognition (OCR), translation, and document sentiment analysis on files uploaded by a user. After a user uploads a source image or PDF file and selects a target language for translation, this application will call three external APIs to process, translate and analyze the source file and then return the results.

## How to use this app

1) Spin up the application on your local webserver and access the ~/index.php file.

2) 3 sample text files (1 x PDF, 2 x TIFFs) have been included in the root directory for testing purposes.
